Module 3 Project Assignment Code Book

1. Dataset downloaded and extracted under the folder called UCI HAR Dataset

2. Assigning data to variables

features <- features.txt : 561 rows, 2 columns
The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ.

activities <- activity_labels.txt : 6 rows, 2 columns
List of activities performed when the corresponding measurements were taken and its codes (labels)

x_test <- test/X_test.txt : 2947 rows, 561 columns
contains recorded features test data

y_test <- test/y_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 columns
contains test data of activities’code labels

subject_test <- test/subject_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 column
contains test data of 9/30 volunteer test subjects being observed

x_train <- test/X_train.txt : 7352 rows, 561 columns
contains recorded features train data

y_train <- test/y_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 columns
contains train data of activities’code labels

subject_train <- test/subject_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 column
contains train data of 21/30 volunteer subjects being observed

3. Merging the datasets

mergedX (10299 rows, 561 columns) is created by merging x_train and x_test using rbind() function
mergedY (10299 rows, 1 column) is created by merging y_train and y_test using rbind() function
mergedsubject (10299 rows, 1 column) is created by merging subject_train and subject_test using rbind() function
MergedData (10299 rows, 563 column) is created by merging mergedsubject, mergedY and mergedX using cbind() function

4. Extracting standard deviation and mean for each measurement

TidyData (10299 rows, 88 columns) is created by subsetting MergedData, selecting only columns: subject, code and the measurements on the mean and standard deviation (std) for each measurement

5. Giving descriptive labels

code column in TidyData renamed into activities
Acc in column’s name replaced by Accelerometer
Gyro in column’s name replaced by Gyroscope
BodyBody in column’s name replaced by Body
Mag in column’s name replaced by Magnitude
All those that start with character f in column’s name replaced by Frequency
All those that start with character t in column’s name replaced by Time
